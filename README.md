README for COMP20
by: Minh D. Nguyen

1. Purpose: This repository keeps track of my work (labs and assignments) in COMP20 - Web Development class. 

2. Favorite lab/assignment: My favorite lab/assignment is assigment 4 - security. This assignment allows me to dive into an important issue of Computer Science that is not mentioned in my other CS classes, brings me another perspective of programming (the perspective of an attacker), and teaches me how to analyze every minor detail.

3. My progress: I have become someone who knows nothing about web programming and networking to someone who has an idea of what is going on under the hood. I understand the main process that happens when I type "google.com" into my web browser and hit return, and also I am now capable of develop a very simple web app from scratch. However, I still have a lot to learn to build a fully functional and secured web app using the latest technology.

4. The most important thing that I have learnt: NEVER TRUST USER INPUT!
- Example 1: All of the vulnerabilities in my assignment 4 partner's code come from some sort of user input.
- Example 2: As Ming's example in class has pointed out, even if there is only one input that is not properly sanitized, it can be exploited (using XSS) so that no one can access the web page properly at all.

5. Topic for further research; I would want to research deeper into security issues.

README for COMP20 Assignment 4

Name: Minh D. Nguyen

I have addressed 3 issues regarding web vulnerabilities:
- The first issue is Cross Site Scripting, which is an obvious high severity security issue.
- The second is a malicious data storage issue that mildly affects the performance of the application and also the experience of all users.
- The third is a potential privacy problem resulting from lack of name checking that will become severe if MongoDB changes its rules regarding data storage.
- I am not entirely sure that the second issue can be thought of as a security/privacy issue.

Acknowledgement: In order to finish the work:
- I consulted various talks on Web Security such as Ming's DEFCON 21 talk, Veracode's XSS tutorial, etc.
- I received help from TA Flora Liu on how to detect issues that are not obvious.
